# CS-CourseWork
Computer Science course work at Centrale Lyon 

## Introduction
Technological advances have enabled the emergence of new computer science professions in the fields of artificial intelligence,
data science, web technology, cybersecurity, networks, computer graphics, formal methods and 'optimization.
The objective of the department Mathematics-Informatics (MI) is to provide future graduates with the fundamental knowledge.
Present at all levels in society, the economy or science, this discipline must be mastered by any engineer or researcher,
whatever his field.
The department relies on its LIRIS laboratory, whose teams cover almost all current IT activities.
Within the MI department, the Computer Science module of the 1st year aims to provide students with the skills to model a
problem, design a resolution algorithm and propose a correct implementation.
From problem to solution, this course combines pragmatic, practical and theoretical approaches to computer

## Programme
The programming language used will be the Python language.
To resume what has been developped before, the brief program of this module is :
- Upgrade (and reminders of notions) in Python
- Object Oriented Analysis and Programming (AOO/POO in Python) and presentation of different concepts in P.O.O.
- Presentation of "classic" data structures (arrays, lists, stacks, queues, graphs and trees,).
- Discovery of the main concepts of algorithmics through case studies on problems such as sorting, traversing
