# Algorithms and Data structures course work at Centrale Lyon


## Objectives
The objective of this course is to introduce the fundamentals of algorithms and data structures, necessary for students who
intend to become engineers. Students will be introduced to the analysis of problems, the design and implementation of
algorithms but also to their applications in the industry, through lectures, practical sessions and a business opening. practical
